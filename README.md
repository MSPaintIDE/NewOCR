# NewOCR
This project is meant to be a testing environment (Will migrate to a proper implementation later on) to create a new OCR for MS Paint IDE. It's a possibility nobody will ever see this repo, because 90% of the code is debug-related, uses horrible organization, and is nothing I would want to show anyone. Wait, why am I typing this just to remind myself? Huh, whatever.

## Resources
The following papers were used as inspiration, ideas, knowledge gathering, whatever it may be towards the advancement of this OCR. I could have forgotten a few research papers, I read a lot of them. They might just be stuff I thought was really cool related to the subject, I'm generalizing this description to hell so I won't have to change it later.
